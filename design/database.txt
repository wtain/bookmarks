Comments modelling

1. Comments as a separate entity

comments = [
  {
  	id: 1,
  	bookmarkId: 1,
  	text: "Comment 1"
  },
  {
  	id: 2,
  	bookmarkId: 1,
  	text: "Comment 2"
  },
  {
  	id: 3,
  	bookmarkId: 2,
  	text: "Comment 3"
  }
]

pros:
- Separate entities

cons:
- Cascade removal is required upon bookmark removal



2. Comments as a bookmark field

bookmarks = [
  {
  	id: 1,
  	summary: "Summary 1",
  	contents: "Contents",
  	comments: [
  	  {
  	    id: 1,
  	    text: "comment 1"
  	  },
  	  {
  	    id: 2,
  	    text: "comment 2"
  	  }
  	]
  }
]

pros:
- Comments are deleted automatically

cons:
- It is required to remove comments when loading bookmark list
- Editing bookmark also affects comments (needs to be careful)
